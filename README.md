# PolyParser
A converter for Poly Bridge 2's .layout files, written in C++. Similar to PolyConverter, but is over 25x faster and does not require the game to be installed.

# How to use

1. Open Command Prompt or your favorite terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory you have PolyParser downloaded to.
3. Run `./PolyParser "<path to layout>"` (or `./PolyParser.exe "<path to layout>"` for Windows)
4. The converted layout should be in the same directory as the original.
